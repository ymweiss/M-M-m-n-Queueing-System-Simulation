# M-M-m-n-Queueing-System-Simulation
Credits to Professor Izhak Rubin for providing the original files for simulating a
M/M/1 queing system.

A Matlab license is needed for running the simulation.
To use: clone the ropository or copy and paste the contents of the files.
Then use Matlab's IDE to set the simulation parameters in main.m to the desired values.
